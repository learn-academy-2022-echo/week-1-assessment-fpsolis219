# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: To my understanding git is a controlled version pragram set up that lets you program code in a local setting such as in your computer. Github is the online pragramming system thats also controlled but is open to a variety of people to share and work on pragrammings together.

Researched answer: Git is a opened source programming system that has version control and its used throughout the programming world. Github is the same concept except that it can be hosted online with a controlled version setting. It allows many programers to collaborate with the integrated controlled version and provides tools to help manage those collaborations.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: comparison operators 

Researched answer: boolean is a datatype that evaluates a variable with values that have a common ground or at least a truth. comparison operator such as: <, >, <=, >=, will return a boolean value as well as logical operators such as: AND statements (&&), OR statements (||), and NOT statements (!). 

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: index is the number of place values within a character and is numbered from 0 to however long the character is. A value is the character within a variable.

Researched answer: index is the place address of a character. It provides us the ability to access the value within that place index in an array and modify it if need be. A value is a character in a variable that can be assigned and reasigned.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: iterations is a repetive coding system that evaluates multiple outcomes in a controlled condition.

Researched answer: the process of executing code over and over again until it meets the condition that was initially set to.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: pair programmer requires an observer to guide, think of ideas and suggest things to the driver whereas the driver is executing and building code.

Researched answer: proper pair programming requires a observer and a driver. a observer analyzes what to do in and suggest improvements or suggestions whereas the driver takes the wheel of initiating code and seeks guidance from the observer when needed.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

2. Jest: jest is a framework designed for large web applications to focus on simplicity and support

3. Objects: in javascript, an object is used to store keyed collection and complex entities.

4. Method: it is a javascript property containing a function definition

5. Classes: classed are codes that encompany multiple objects, methods, and allows manipulations within variables and functions.
